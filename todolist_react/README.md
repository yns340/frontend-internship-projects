# React ToDo List Application

This project is a **ToDo List Application** developed to get closer to a professional project structure and learn the **React framework**. It demonstrates how React allows code reuse and component-based development.

## Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: React components are defined as functions and can be reused across different parts of the application without repeating code.  
- **JSX & CSS Modules**: Components use JSX (HTML-like syntax) along with CSS modules to create the design and functionality.  
- **Dynamic JavaScript in Design**: JavaScript code can be easily embedded within the design using curly braces `{}` in `.jsx` files.

## Usage

- Add, edit, and remove tasks in the ToDo list.  
- Learn how React components interact with JSX and CSS modules to build dynamic UIs.  

## Technologies

- React  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- CSS Modules
